Construction of a L-S equity investment strategy using ensemble tree algorithms for capturing non-linearity in factor payoffs

This model uses Decision Trees, Random Forests, Ada Boosting and Gradient boosting techniques for constructing a L-S equity investment strategy based on quarterly earnings data.
The model also uses recursive feature elimination using feature importance and profit importance.
